CUBE (CUBE Uniform Behavioral Encoding) is a generic presentation component
suitable for displaying a wide variety of performance metrics for parallel
programs including MPI and OpenMP applications. CUBE allows interactive
exploration of a multidimensional performance space in a scalable fashion.
Scalability is achieved in two ways: hierarchical decomposition of individual
dimensions and aggregation across different dimensions. All performance
metrics are uniformly accommodated in the same display and thus provide the
ability to easily compare the effects of different kinds of performance
behavior.
