1. Download Cube 4.4 TP3 C++ Library and GUI from http://www.scalasca.org/software/cube-4.x/download.html
2. Install them somewhere in some directory <cubedir>.
   - is typical autotools installation routine, see INSTALL
3. take look at <src>/GUI-qt/plugins/CubeDiff
   This is a so-called context-free Cube Plugin, it performs an operation "diff" between two cube files and loads the result.
  There are more of such operations like  "Mean", "Merge" or others. They are implemented as separate command-line tools within Cube C++ library.
5. Create next to "CubeDiff" the  "CubeMerge" or "CubeMean" (choose one) plugin in the source tree
6. Adjust build system of Cube to build it (edit a .am file)
7. Implement corresponding functionality of this plugin:
    - algebra is implemented in cube c++ library header <algebra4.>


As reference, see Plugin API in
http://apps.fz-juelich.de/scalasca/releases/cube/4.3/docs/CubeGuiPluginDeveloperGuide.pdf

and

or better(!) take look at API in  PluginService.h of CubeGUI.

If you have ANY questions to this (i could have made some typo or documentation is incomplete) - do not hesitate to ask me.

In this way i can estimate which tasks would come upon you in case of employment and you can estimate whether you want/can to work here.
